# SWAPI SpringBoot App

This is a process API Layer midway between the main UI React App and the SWAPI api service . 
It supports offline functionality as well using cache .

The architecture followed in this project is MVC

Model : represents the data or business logic of the application. This can include entities, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), or any other objects that encapsulate the application's data.
View : In context of API , the "View" is effectively replaced by the representation of the data returned by the API endpoints.
Controller :  Controllers in Spring Boot API applications handle incoming HTTP requests and determine how to process them .
